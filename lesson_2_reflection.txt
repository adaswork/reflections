How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area is a placeholder for bundling the files from working 
    directory that needs to be committed to repository as a single 
    commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

    As you make changes to the working directory, we can add files 
    related to a logical change into staging and commit them once all 
    the files are added for that logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your 
history organized? How would branches help?

    If I want to experiment separately, I can create a branch while
    others in the team can continue to make changes as planned. When
    I am ready with my experiment, I can merge my changes.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    Helps to clearly understand which features / changes have been made
    from master in which chronological order. This will help in merging
    code later

merges manually?

    Pros: Most simple merges which is the volume of the work, gets done
    reliably and automatically by Git. This saves time. However, the 
    areas where conflicts are present are better merged manually for 
    more accurate code implementation.

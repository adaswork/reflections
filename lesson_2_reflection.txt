What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    It creates a .git folder. It is a hidden folder that contains the
    status of the local repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area is a placeholder for bundling the files from working 
    directory that needs to be committed to repository as a single 
    commit.
